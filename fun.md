# For Fun ðŸ¤ª: Programming Competitions

Programming competitions are a fun way to learn and practice problem solving skills. They are also a great way to challenge yourself and improve your programming abilities. There are many different types of programming competitions, ranging from local hackathons to international competitions with thousands of participants.

The biggest programming competition is the [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/). ICPC is a team-based competition that challenges students to solve a series of complex problems in a limited amount of time. The competition is held annually and attracts teams from universities around the world. 

The problems in the competition are designed to test a wide range of skills, including algorithm design, data structures, and problem solving. [Problems Archive](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/problems) from the past years of ICPC World Finals.




The [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) is another popular programming competition that is open to students of all skill levels. The competition is held annually and features a series of online rounds that culminate in a final round at Google's headquarters in California.
