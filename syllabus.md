## Prerequisites

**CSC-121**: Introduction to Computer Programming
 
## Number of credits
2 credits 

## Course Description

This course is designed to prepare students for [Programming Competitions](fun.html) and [Coding Interviews](profit.html). Every meeting will include a problem solving session where students will be expected to solve problems in a limited time frame. The problems will be selected from previous national and regional competitions and commonly given problems in technical interviews. The instructor will provide guidance and feedback to the teams after the problem solving sessions. The class is going to be modelled as a course-length tournament and/or game show. 

Students will also be expected to complete assignments for practice and to participate in external programming contests and mock coding interviews. 

## Course Objectives

1. Broadly enhance student abilities in programming under time constraints.
2. Prepare students to compete in national and regional programming competitions 
3. Help students prepare for technical interviews in their job search 

## Learning Outcomes

1. Develop and sharpen problem solving skills
2. Solving a wide breadth of problems using a variety of algorithmic strategies 
3. Learning to effectively communicate understanding and solution to a problem
4. Demonstrating the ability to improvise and think quickly on their feet 
5. The ability to work effectively in a team and collaborate with others towards solving a problem

## Meeting Times

The class meets all 5 weekdays,  <b><u>Monday through Friday</u></b>, for 3 hours each day from <u><b>9:30 AM - 12:30 PM</b></u>.

The course is comprised of **15 meetings** from **May 8th - May 29th**, 2024.

There will be **no meeting** on **Memorial Day** on May 27th, 2024.

You are expected to work outside of class for at least 1.5 hours a weekday. This is a 2 credit course and you should expect to spend at least 4.5 hours a day on this course.

As a rule of thumb, students should expect a minimum average total commitment of in- and out-of-class work time (broadly defined) of approximately 4.5 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks (15 official class days) for a grand total of approximately 67.5 hours.

This 67.5 hours (half of the expectations for a typical 4 credit class) represents an approximate total of in-class meetings and out-of-class conferences, reading, media viewing, problem solving, writing, practice, preparation, labs, reflection, fieldwork, workshopping, etc.

4.5 hours a day * 5 days a week * for 3 weeks (15 official class days) = ~ 67.5 hours


Each class would contain at least one computer programming problem. Students are expected to turn in at least 80% of the in-class problems within one hour maximum of the end of the class duration. 

To pass the class, students have to be present for at least 80% of the classes.
