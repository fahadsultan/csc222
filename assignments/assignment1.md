# Assignment 1 

## Due May 9th, 2024 11:59 PM

## Task 1
 
In this course, we will be using LeetCode to practice coding interview questions and to conduct mock interviews.
 
Please sign up for a free account [here](https://leetcode.com/accounts/signup/) if you do not already have one.
 
For this MayX, Furman University, in collaboration with the Computer Science department, has graciously offered to pay for a 30-day LeetCode premium subscription for all students enrolled in the course.
 
LeetCode Premium is a paid service that offers additional features on top of the free service. These features include:
 
* Access to Premium Questions
* Video Solutions
* Filter Interview Questions by Company: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Interview Simulations
 
Once you are signed up, please upgrade to premium using the following [link](https://leetcode.com/subscribe/)
 
Make sure you <b><u>select Monthly subscription (not Yearly)</u></b>. Use your own personal credit card to sign up but forward the email receipt (titled â€˜Your receipt from LeetCodeâ€™ followed by order number) to Kala Kennemore at [kala.kennemore@furman.edu](mailto:kala.kennemore@furman.edu) and she will reimburse you. For reimbursement, Kala will use the bank account information you provided to the university on workday. Please make sure you have your bank account information up to date.

No receipts will be accepted after May 9th, 2024. If you do not forward the receipt by this date, you will not be reimbursed for the subscription.
 
Please note that if you do not wish to continue with the subscription after the 30 days, you will need to cancel your subscription before the 30 days are up to avoid being charged for the next month.
 
## Task 2

Watch the following mock technical interview:

</center>

This is what I am aiming for when we have our mock interviews on May 28th, 2024, worth 10% of your grade.

Submit a short reflection (1-2 paragraphs) on what you learned from the video. What surprised you? What did you find helpful?

## Task 3

Fill out the pre-course survey on Moodle.
