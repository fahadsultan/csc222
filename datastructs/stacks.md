# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are inserted and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack. The operations on a stack are as follows:

1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.

2. **Pop**: Remove and return the element at the top of the stack.

3. **Peek**: Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

4. **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The array-based implementation is more common due to its simplicity and efficiency.
