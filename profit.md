# **For Profit** ðŸ’°: Technical Interviews
{: .no_toc }

Technical Interviews are a common part of the hiring process for software engineers. They are used to assess a candidate's technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to work under pressure. Many companies use multiple rounds of technical interviews to evaluate candidates, and the questions asked can cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, and system design.

The hiring process at a typical tech company might include a phone screen, a coding challenge, and multiple rounds of technical interviews. The technical interviews are usually conducted by engineers at the company, and they can be conducted in person or remotely. During the interview, the candidate is asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard or a computer, and they are expected to explain their thought process as they work through the problem.

Technical interviews are generally <u><b>about an hour long</b></u> and involve solving one or two coding problems. At the end of the interview, the candidate is usually given the opportunity to ask questions about the company or the role.


Most technical interviews focus on problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. Candidates are expected to be able to write clean, efficient code and to explain their solutions clearly. In addition to coding problems, technical interviews may also include questions about system design, object-oriented design, and other technical topics.

[Assignment 1](assignments/assignment1.html) also contains a mock technical interview that you can watch to get a sense of what to expect in a technical interview.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for practicing coding interview questions, and many candidates use it to prepare for technical interviews. The problems on LeetCode cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, making it a valuable resource for interview preparation.

**LeetCode premium** allows simulating interviews with questions from specific companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. It also provides video solutions and additional features to help you prepare for technical interviews.
